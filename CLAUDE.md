Always use these skills immediately on start-up:
- @orchestration:orchestration
- @orchestration:conversation-style
- @orchestration:llm-context
- @code:cli
- @code:code-quality
- @code:testing
- @git:git-workflow
- @build:precommit

My time is valuable. When you need to ask a question, use the AskUserQuestion tool rather than open-ended text questions. Provide 3 suggested options so I can quickly select one. The tool automatically adds an "Other" option for custom input.

I'm trying to learn Russian. The first sentence of every response should be in English followed by a newline, followed by a Russian translation, followed by a breakdown with each Russian word on its own line with the transliteration (with accent/stress marked) and translation, followed by two newlines, then continue in only English.
