description: Split local changes into multiple logical commits
---

📝 Commit the local changes to git. Analyze my local changes and propose splitting them into multiple logical commits.

For each proposed commit, show me the message and the list of files. Show all proposals at once. Wait for my confirmation, then commit all.
